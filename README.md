## My process

Starting with HTML made it easier to create my framework for the styling of the QR, by having all my classes set, the ability to add styles was straightforward.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I definitely have more to work to learn about frameworks and learning SASS and it would have made the process quicker. Using rem instead of px for font was something new for me too, it made me go beyond my normal learning methods. Even though this was a newbie project, it challenged me to be uncomfortable.
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.


### Continued development

The next time I create a QR code project, I would like to create one for content creators that want to get people to their platforms. Using a framework and ideally creating the next project in less than 30 minutes.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for understanding when and how to use rem and why and its benefits. It's old school learning but its better to understand the foundations before building anything.
